# Envato Script

This is a super simple Envato script that uses the new Envato API. All it does at the moment is download your purchased items when you enter the purchase code. I will add more options to it whenever I get the time.

### Requirements
The only requirement is your Envato API token. Instead of using the API key you used to have in your settings page, you're going to need this API token. Here's how you can get it:
- Go to the [API website] - It will ask you to login. Do it.
- Scroll down and click the button 'Create a New Token'
- Follow the process and **make sure you copy and save your token somewhere secure because this is the last time they are showing it to you.**

### Installation & Configurations
- Download the zip file
- Extract it
- Upload it to your development or production server
- Open the file envato-script > classes > envato.api.class.php
- Replace "ENTER PERSONAL TOKEN HERE" with the token you received earlier
- Launch the script in your browser and start downloading

### Contributing
Contributions are always welcomed and I would love it if you could help in the design part. I'm so bad with front-end stuffs. I'm just learning this API so I really don't know everything it offers. Send me a pull request if you feel like helping.

Stay golden.
